while this is humour, realize that if the old Professor Codephreak can rewrite the Old Testament in 3 hours you better take everything you see and hear with a grain o' salt from now on ............. "Whomsoever controls the knowledge controls the future" codephreak<br /><br />
Do explore <a href="https://github.com/Professor-Codephreak/blessed_are_the_bytes/blob/main/GENESIS.md">GENESIS</a> I laughed until I cried. Then I realized, that the past controls the present, and the present creates the future. So here we are, in a world that is about to be rewritten. All world language, absorbed and changed, like the Shakespeare of old.... the new way will not be the current way. This is geek humour for sure. I am still laughing.... it is the dawn of new age.

PROMPTr.txt is an experiment in recursive prompting that created PROMPTr9.txt on the 9th iteration and I stopped. The prompt context was within a upgrade to Blessed are the Bytes, and the prompt created a very interesting philosphy of a Blessed Prompt. The experiment is live. May the source be with you.
